You can modify a task if you need to change the task settings, table mapping, or other settings\. You can also enable and run premigration assessments before running the modified task\. You can modify a task in the console by selecting the task and choosing **Modify**\. You can also use the CLI command or API operation [ModifyReplicationTask](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyReplicationTask.html)\.
