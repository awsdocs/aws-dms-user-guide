# Setting LOB support for source databases in an AWS DMS task<a name="CHAP_Tasks.LOBSupport"></a>

Large binary objects \(LOBs\) can sometimes be difficult to migrate between systems\. AWS DMS offers a number of options to help with the tuning of LOB columns\. To see which and when data types are considered LOBs by AWS DMS, see the AWS DMS documentation\.

When you migrate data from one database to another, you might take the opportunity to rethink how your LOBs are stored, especially for heterogeneous migrations\. If you want to do so, there's no need to migrate the LOB data\.

If you decide to include LOBs, you can then decide the other LOB settings:
+ The LOB mode determines how LOBs are handled:
  + **Full LOB mode** – In full LOB mode AWS DMS migrates all LOBs from source to target regardless of size\. In this configuration, AWS DMS has no information about the maximum size of LOBs to expect\. Thus, LOBs are migrated one at a time, piece by piece\. Full LOB mode can be quite slow\.
  + **Limited LOB mode** – In limited LOB mode, you set a maximum LOB size for DMS to accept\. That enables DMS to pre\-allocate memory and load the LOB data in bulk\. LOBs that exceed the maximum LOB size are truncated, and a warning is issued to the log file\. In limited LOB mode, you can gain significant performance over full LOB mode\. We recommend that you use limited LOB mode whenever possible\. The maximum recommended value is 102400 KB \(100 MB\)\.
**Note**  
Using the Max LOB size \(K\) option with a value greater than 63KB impacts the performance of a full load configured to run in limited LOB mode\. During a full load, DMS allocates memory by multiplying the Max LOB size \(k\) value by the Commit rate, and the product is multiplied by the number of LOB columns\. When DMS can’t pre\-allocate that memory, DMS starts consuming SWAP memory, and that impacts performance of a full load\. So, if you experience performance issues when using limited LOB mode, consider decreasing the commit rate until you achieve an acceptable level of performance\. You can also consider using inline LOB mode for supported endpoints once you understand your LOB distribution for the table\.  
To validate limited LOB size, you must set `ValidationPartialLobSize` to the same value as `LobMaxSize` \(K\)\.
  + **Inline LOB mode** – In inline LOB mode, you set the maximum LOB size that DMS transfers inline\. LOBs smaller than the specified size are transferred inline\. LOBs larger than the specified size are replicated using full LOB mode\. You can select this option to replicate both small and large LOBs when most of the LOBs are small\. DMS doesn’t support inline LOB mode for endpoints that don’t support Full LOB mode, like S3 and Redshift\.
**Note**  
With Oracle, LOBs are treated as VARCHAR data types whenever possible\. This approach means that AWS DMS fetches them from the database in bulk, which is significantly faster than other methods\. The maximum size of a VARCHAR in Oracle is 32 K\. Therefore, a limited LOB size of less than 32 K is optimal when Oracle is your source database\.
+ When a task is configured to run in limited LOB mode, the **Max LOB size \(K\)** option sets the maximum size LOB that AWS DMS accepts\. Any LOBs that are larger than this value is truncated to this value\.
+ When a task is configured to use full LOB mode, AWS DMS retrieves LOBs in pieces\. The **LOB chunk size \(K\)** option determines the size of each piece\. When setting this option, pay particular attention to the maximum packet size allowed by your network configuration\. If the LOB chunk size exceeds your maximum allowed packet size, you might see disconnect errors\. The recommended value for `LobChunkSize` is 64 kilobytes\. Increasing the value for `LobChunkSize` above 64 kilobytes can cause task failures\.
+ When a task is configured to run in inline LOB mode, the `InlineLobMaxSize` setting determines which LOBs DMS transfers inline\.
