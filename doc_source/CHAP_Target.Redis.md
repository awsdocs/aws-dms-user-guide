# Using Redis as a target for AWS Database Migration Service<a name="CHAP_Target.Redis"></a>

Redis is an open\-source in\-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker\. Managing data in\-memory can result in read or write operations taking less than a millisecond, and hundreds of millions of operations performed each second\. As an in\-memory data store, Redis powers the most demanding applications requiring sub\-millisecond response times\.

Using AWS DMS, you can migrate data from any supported source database to a target Redis data store with minimal downtime\. For additional information about Redis see, [Redis Documentation](https://redis.io/documentation)\.

In addition to on\-premises Redis, AWS Database Migration Service supports the following:
+ [Amazon ElastiCache for Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/redis/) as a target data store\. ElastiCache for Redis works with your Redis clients and uses the open Redis data format to store your data\.
+ [Amazon MemoryDB for Redis](https://aws.amazon.com/memorydb/) as a target data store\. MemoryDB is compatible with Redis and enables you to build applications using all the Redis data structures, APIs, and commands in use today\.

For additional information about working with Redis as a target for AWS DMS, see the following sections:

## Prerequisites for using a Redis cluster as a target for AWS DMS<a name="CHAP_Target.Redis.Prerequisites"></a>

DMS supports an on\-premises Redis target in a standalone configuration, or as a Redis cluster where data is automatically *sharded* across multiple nodes\. Sharding is the process of separating data into smaller chunks called shards that are spread across multiple servers or nodes\. In effect, a shard is a data partition that contains a subset of the total data set, and serves a slice of the overall workload\.

Since Redis is a key\-value NoSQL data store, the Redis key naming convention to use when your source is a relational database, is **schema\-name\.table\-name\.primary\-key**\. In Redis, the key and value must not contain the special character %\. Otherwise, DMS skips the record\. 

**Note**  
If you are using ElastiCache for Redis as a target, DMS supports *cluster mode enabled* configurations only\. For more information about using ElastiCache for Redis version 6\.x or later to create a cluster mode enabled target data store, see [Getting started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/GettingStarted.html) in the *Amazon ElastiCache for Redis User Guide*\. 

Before you begin a database migration, launch your Redis cluster with the following criteria\.
+ Your cluster has one or more shards\.
+ If you're using an ElastiCache for Redis target, ensure that your cluster doesn't use IAM role\-based access control\. Instead, use Redis Auth to authenticate users\.
+ Enable Multi\-AZ \(Availability Zones\)\.
+ Ensure the cluster has sufficient memory available to fit the data to be migrated from your database\. 
+ Make sure that your target Redis cluster is clear of all data before starting the initial migration task\.

You should determine your security requirements for the data migration prior to creating your cluster configuration\. DMS supports migration to target replication groups regardless of their encryption configuration\. But you can enable or disable encryption only when you create your cluster configuration\.

## Limitations when using Redis as a target for AWS Database Migration Service<a name="CHAP_Target.Redis.Limitations"></a>

The following limitations apply when using Redis as a target:
+ Since Redis is a key\-value no\-sql data store, the Redis key naming convention to use when your source is a relational database, is `schema-name.table-name.primary-key`\. 
+ In Redis, the key\-value can't contain the special character `%`\. Otherwise, DMS skips the record\.
+ DMS won't migrate rows that contain special characters\.
+ DMS won't migrate fields that contain special characters in the field name\.
+ Full LOB mode is not supported\.
+  A private Certificate Authority \(CA\) isn’t supported when using ElastiCache for Redis as a target\.

## Migrating data from a relational or non\-relational database to a Redis target<a name="CHAP_Target.Redis.Migrating"></a>

You can migrate data from any source SQL or NoSQL data store directly to a Redis target\. Setting up and starting a migration to a Redis target is similar to any full load and change data capture migration using the DMS console or API\. To perform a database migration to a Redis target, you do the following\.
+ Create a replication instance to perform all the processes for the migration\. For more information, see [Creating a replication instance](CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Creating.md)\.
+ Specify a source endpoint\. For more information, see [Creating source and target endpoints](CHAP_Endpoints.Creating.md)\.
+ Locate the DNS name and port number of your cluster\.
+ Download a certificate bundle that you can use to verify SSL connections\.
+ Specify a target endpoint, as described below\.
+ Create a task or set of tasks to define what tables and replication processes you want to use\. For more information, see [Creating a task](CHAP_Tasks.Creating.md)\.
+ Migrate data from your source database to your target cluster\.

You begin a database migration in one of two ways:

1. You can choose the AWS DMS console and perform each step there\.

1. You can use the AWS Command Line Interface \(AWS CLI\)\. For more information about using the CLI with AWS DMS, see [AWS CLI for AWS DMS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/dms/index.html)\.

**To locate the DNS name and port number of your cluster**
+ Use the following AWS CLI command to provide the `replication-group-id` with the name of your replication group\.

  ```
  aws elasticache describe-replication-groups --replication-group-id myreplgroup
  ```

  Here, the output shows the DNS name in the `Address` attribute and the port number in the `Port` attribute of the primary node in the cluster\. 

  ```
   ...
  "ReadEndpoint": {
  "Port": 6379,
  "Address": "myreplgroup-
  111.1abc1d.1111.uuu1.cache.example.com"
  }
  ...
  ```

  If you are using MemoryDB for Redis as your target, use the following AWS CLI command to provide an endpoint address to your Redis cluster\. 

  ```
  aws memorydb describe-clusters --clusterid clusterid
  ```

**Download a certificate bundle for use to verify SSL connections**
+ Enter the following `wget` command at the command line\. Wget is a free GNU command\-line utility tool used to download files from the internet\.

  ```
  wget https://s3.aws-api-domain/rds-downloads/rds-combined-ca-bundle.pem
  ```

  Here, `aws-api-domain` completes the Amazon S3 domain in your AWS Region required to access the speciﬁed S3 bucket and the rds\-combined\-ca\-bundle\.pem ﬁle that it provides\.

**To create a target endpoint using the AWS DMS console**

This endpoint is for your Redis target that is already running\. 
+ On the console, choose **Endpoints** from the navigation pane and then choose **Create Endpoint**\. The following table describes the settings\.    
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Target.Redis.html)

When you're finished providing all information for your endpoint, AWS DMS creates your Redis target endpoint for use during database migration\.

For information about creating a migration task and starting your database migration, see [Creating a task](CHAP_Tasks.Creating.md)\.

## Specifying endpoint settings for Redis as a target<a name="CHAP_Target.Redis.EndpointSettings"></a>

To create or modify a target endpoint, you can use the console or the `CreateEndpoint` or `ModifyEndpoint` API operations\. 

For a Redis target in the AWS DMS console, specify **Endpoint\-specific settings** on the **Create endpoint** or **Modify endpoint** console page\.

When using `CreateEndpoint` and `ModifyEndpoint` API operations, specify request parameters for the `RedisSettings` option\. The example following shows how to do this using the AWS CLI\.

```
aws dms create-endpoint --endpoint-identifier my-redis-target
--endpoint-type target --engine-name redis --redis-settings 
'{"ServerName":"sample-test-sample.zz012zz.cluster.eee1.cache.bbbxxx.com","Port":6379,"AuthType":"auth-token", 
 "SslSecurityProtocol":"ssl-encryption", "AuthPassword":"notanactualpassword"}'

{
    "Endpoint": {
        "EndpointIdentifier": "my-redis-target",
        "EndpointType": "TARGET",
        "EngineName": "redis",
        "EngineDisplayName": "Redis",
        "TransferFiles": false,
        "ReceiveTransferredFiles": false,
        "Status": "active",
        "KmsKeyId": "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:999999999999:key/x-b188188x",
        "EndpointArn": "arn:aws:dms:us-east-1:555555555555:endpoint:ABCDEFGHIJKLMONOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
        "SslMode": "none",
        "RedisSettings": {
            "ServerName": "sample-test-sample.zz012zz.cluster.eee1.cache.bbbxxx.com",
            "Port": 6379,
            "SslSecurityProtocol": "ssl-encryption",
            "AuthType": "auth-token"
        }
    }
}
```

The `--redis-settings` parameters follow:
+ `ServerName`–\(Required\) Of type `string`, specifies the Redis cluster that data will be migrated to, and is in your same VPC\.
+ `Port`–\(Required\) Of type `number`, the port value used to access the endpoint\.
+ `SslSecurityProtocol`–\(Optional\) Valid values include `plaintext` and `ssl-encryption`\. The default is `ssl-encryption`\. 

  The `plaintext` option doesn't provide Transport Layer Security \(TLS\) encryption for traffic between endpoint and database\. 

  Use `ssl-encryption` to make an encrypted connection\. `ssl-encryption` doesn’t require an SSL Certificate Authority \(CA\) ARN to verify a server’s certificate, but one can be identified optionally using the `SslCaCertificateArn` setting\. If a certificate authority ARN isn't given, DMS uses the Amazon root CA\.

  When using an on\-premises Redis target, you can use `SslCaCertificateArn` to import public or private Certificate Authority \(CA\) into DMS, and provide that ARN for server authentication\. A private CA isn’t supported when using ElastiCache for Redis as a target\.
+ `AuthType`–\(Required\) Indicates the type of authentication to perform when connecting to Redis\. Valid values include `none`, `auth-token`, and `auth-role`\.

  The `auth-token` option requires an "*AuthPassword*" be provided, while the `auth-role` option requires "*AuthUserName*" and "*AuthPassword*" be provided\.
