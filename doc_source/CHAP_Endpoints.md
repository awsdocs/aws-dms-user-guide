# Working with AWS DMS endpoints<a name="CHAP_Endpoints"></a>

An endpoint provides connection, data store type, and location information about your data store\. AWS Database Migration Service uses this information to connect to a data store and migrate data from a source endpoint to a target endpoint\. You can specify additional connection attributes for an endpoint by using endpoint settings\. These settings can control logging, file size, and other parameters; for more information about endpoint settings, see the documentation section for your data store\. 

Following, you can find out more details about endpoints\.
