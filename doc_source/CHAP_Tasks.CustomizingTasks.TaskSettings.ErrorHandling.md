# Error handling task settings<a name="CHAP_Tasks.CustomizingTasks.TaskSettings.ErrorHandling"></a>



You can set the error handling behavior of your replication task during change data capture \(CDC\) using the following settings\. For information about how to use a task configuration file to set task settings, see [Task settings example](CHAP_Tasks.CustomizingTasks.TaskSettings.md#CHAP_Tasks.CustomizingTasks.TaskSettings.Example)\.
+ `DataErrorPolicy` – Determines the action AWS DMS takes when there is an error related to data processing at the record level\. Some examples of data processing errors include conversion errors, errors in transformation, and bad data\. The default is `LOG_ERROR`\.
  + `IGNORE_RECORD` – The task continues and the data for that record is ignored\. The error counter for the `DataErrorEscalationCount` property is incremented\. Thus, if you set a limit on errors for a table, this error counts toward that limit\. 
  + `LOG_ERROR` – The task continues and the error is written to the task log\.
  + `SUSPEND_TABLE` – The task continues but data from the table with the error record is moved into an error state and the data isn't replicated\.
  + `STOP_TASK` – The task stops and manual intervention is required\.
+ `DataTruncationErrorPolicy` – Determines the action AWS DMS takes when data is truncated\. The default is `LOG_ERROR`\.
  + `IGNORE_RECORD` – The task continues and the data for that record is ignored\. The error counter for the `DataErrorEscalationCount` property is incremented\. Thus, if you set a limit on errors for a table, this error counts toward that limit\. 
  + `LOG_ERROR` – The task continues and the error is written to the task log\.
  + `SUSPEND_TABLE` – The task continues but data from the table with the error record is moved into an error state and the data isn't replicated\.
  + `STOP_TASK` – The task stops and manual intervention is required\.
+ `DataErrorEscalationPolicy` – Determines the action AWS DMS takes when the maximum number of errors \(set in the `DataErrorEscalationCount` parameter\) is reached\. The default is `SUSPEND_TABLE`\.
  + `SUSPEND_TABLE` – The task continues but data from the table with the error record is moved into an error state and the data isn't replicated\.
  + `STOP_TASK` – The task stops and manual intervention is required\.
+ `DataErrorEscalationCount` – Sets the maximum number of errors that can occur to the data for a specific record\. When this number is reached, the data for the table that contains the error record is handled according to the policy set in the `DataErrorEscalationPolicy`\. The default is 0\. 
+ `EventErrorPolicy` – Determines the action AWS DMS takes when an error occurs while sending a task\-related event\. Its possible values are
  + `IGNORE` – The task continues and any data associated with that event is ignored\.
  + `STOP_TASK` – The task stops and manual intervention is required\.
+ `TableErrorPolicy` – Determines the action AWS DMS takes when an error occurs when processing data or metadata for a specific table\. This error only applies to general table data and isn't an error that relates to a specific record\. The default is `SUSPEND_TABLE`\.
  + `SUSPEND_TABLE` – The task continues but data from the table with the error record is moved into an error state and the data isn't replicated\.
  + `STOP_TASK` – The task stops and manual intervention is required\.
+ `TableErrorEscalationPolicy` – Determines the action AWS DMS takes when the maximum number of errors \(set using the `TableErrorEscalationCount` parameter\)\. The default and only user setting is `STOP_TASK`, where the task is stopped and manual intervention is required\.
+ `TableErrorEscalationCount` – The maximum number of errors that can occur to the general data or metadata for a specific table\. When this number is reached, the data for the table is handled according to the policy set in the `TableErrorEscalationPolicy`\. The default is 0\. 
+ `RecoverableErrorCount` – The maximum number of attempts made to restart a task when an environmental error occurs\. After the system attempts to restart the task the designated number of times, the task is stopped and manual intervention is required\. The default value is \-1, which instructs AWS DMS to attempt to restart the task indefinitely\. Set this value to 0 to never attempt to restart a task\. If a fatal error occurs, AWS DMS stops attempting to restart the task after six attempts\.
+ `RecoverableErrorInterval` – The number of seconds that AWS DMS waits between attempts to restart a task\. The default is 5\. 
+ `RecoverableErrorThrottling` – When enabled, the interval between attempts to restart a task is increased in a series based on the value of `RecoverableErrorInterval`\. For example, if `RecoverableErrorInterval` is set to 5 seconds, then the next retry will happen after 10 seconds, then 20, then 40 seconds and so on\. The default is `true`\. 
+ `RecoverableErrorThrottlingMax` – The maximum number of seconds that AWS DMS waits between attempts to restart a task if `RecoverableErrorThrottling` is enabled\. The default is 1800\. 
+ `RecoverableErrorStopRetryAfterThrottlingMax` – When set to `true`, stops restarting the task after the maximum number of seconds that AWS DMS waits between recovery attempts is reached, per `RecoverableErrorThrottlingMax`\.
+ `ApplyErrorDeletePolicy` – Determines what action AWS DMS takes when there is a conflict with a DELETE operation\. The default is `IGNORE_RECORD`\. Possible values are the following:
  + `IGNORE_RECORD` – The task continues and the data for that record is ignored\. The error counter for the `ApplyErrorEscalationCount` property is incremented\. Thus, if you set a limit on errors for a table, this error counts toward that limit\. 
  + `LOG_ERROR` – The task continues and the error is written to the task log\.
  + `SUSPEND_TABLE` – The task continues but data from the table with the error record is moved into an error state and the data isn't replicated\.
  + `STOP_TASK` – The task stops and manual intervention is required\.
+ `ApplyErrorInsertPolicy` – Determines what action AWS DMS takes when there is a conflict with an INSERT operation\. The default is `LOG_ERROR`\. Possible values are the following:
  + `IGNORE_RECORD` – The task continues and the data for that record is ignored\. The error counter for the `ApplyErrorEscalationCount` property is incremented\. Thus, if you set a limit on errors for a table, this error counts toward that limit\. 
  + `LOG_ERROR` – The task continues and the error is written to the task log\.
  + `SUSPEND_TABLE` – The task continues but data from the table with the error record is moved into an error state and the data isn't replicated\.
  + `STOP_TASK` – The task stops and manual intervention is required\.
  + `INSERT_RECORD` – If there is an existing target record with the same primary key as the inserted source record, the target record is updated\.
+ `ApplyErrorUpdatePolicy` – Determines what action AWS DMS takes when there is a missing data conflict with an UPDATE operation\. The default is `LOG_ERROR`\. This error handling doesn't support LOBs\. Possible values are the following:
  + `IGNORE_RECORD` – The task continues and the data for that record is ignored\. The error counter for the `ApplyErrorEscalationCount` property is incremented\. Thus, if you set a limit on errors for a table, this error counts toward that limit\. 
  + `LOG_ERROR` – The task continues and the error is written to the task log\.
  + `SUSPEND_TABLE` – The task continues but data from the table with the error record is moved into an error state and the data isn't replicated\.
  + `STOP_TASK` – The task stops and manual intervention is required\.
  + `UPDATE_RECORD` – If the target record is missing, the missing target record is inserted into the target table\. Selecting this option requires full supplemental logging to be enabled for all the source table columns when Oracle is the source database\.
+ `ApplyErrorEscalationPolicy` – Determines what action AWS DMS takes when the maximum number of errors \(set using the `ApplyErrorEscalationCount` parameter\) is reached\. The default is LOG\_ERROR:
  + `LOG_ERROR` – The task continues and the error is written to the task log\.
  + `SUSPEND_TABLE` – The task continues but data from the table with the error record is moved into an error state and the data isn't replicated\.
  + `STOP_TASK` – The task stops and manual intervention is required\.
+ `ApplyErrorEscalationCount` – This option sets the maximum number of APPLY conflicts that can occur for a specific table during a change process operation\. When this number is reached, the table data is handled according to the policy set in the `ApplyErrorEscalationPolicy` parameter\. The default is 0\. 
+ `ApplyErrorFailOnTruncationDdl` – Set this option to `true` to cause the task to fail when a truncation is performed on any of the tracked tables during CDC\. The default is `false`\. 

  This approach doesn't work with PostgreSQL version 11\.x or lower, or any other source endpoint that doesn't replicate DDL table truncation\.
+ `FailOnNoTablesCaptured` – Set this option to `true` to cause a task to fail when the table mappings defined for a task find no tables when the task starts\. The default is `false`\. 
+ `FailOnTransactionConsistencyBreached` – This option applies to tasks using Oracle as a source with CDC\. The default is false\. Set it to `true` to cause a task to fail when a transaction is open for more time than the specified timeout and can be dropped\. 

  When a CDC task starts with Oracle, AWS DMS waits for a limited time for the oldest open transaction to close before starting CDC\. If the oldest open transaction doesn't close until the timeout is reached, then in most cases AWS DMS starts CDC, ignoring that transaction\. If this option is set to `true`, the task fails\.
+ `FullLoadIgnoreConflicts` – Set this option to `true` to have AWS DMS ignore "zero rows affected" and "duplicates" errors when applying cached events\. If set to `false`, AWS DMS reports all errors instead of ignoring them\. The default is `true`\.
