# Using Microsoft Azure SQL database as a source for AWS DMS<a name="CHAP_Source.AzureSQL"></a>

With AWS DMS, you can use Microsoft Azure SQL Database as a source in much the same way as you do SQL Server\. AWS DMS supports, as a source, the same list of database versions that are supported for SQL Server running on\-premises or on an Amazon EC2 instance\. 

For more information, see [Using a Microsoft SQL Server database as a source for AWS DMS](CHAP_Source.SQLServer.md)\.

**Note**  
AWS DMS doesn't support change data capture operations \(CDC\) with Azure SQL Database\.
