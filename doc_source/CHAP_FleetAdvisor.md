# Discover and evaluate databases for migration using AWS DMS Fleet Advisor<a name="CHAP_FleetAdvisor"></a>

AWS DMS Fleet Advisor collects data from multiple database environments to provide insight into your data infrastructure\. [DMS Fleet Advisor](http://aws.amazon.com/dms/fleet-advisor/) collects data from your on\-premises database and analytic servers from one or more central locations without the need to install it on every computer\. Currently, DMS Fleet Advisor supports Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL database servers\.

Based on data discovered from the network, you can build an inventory to define the list of database servers for further data collection\. As details about these servers, databases, and schemas are collected, you can analyze the feasibility of your intended database migrations\.
